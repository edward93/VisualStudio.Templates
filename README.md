# VisualStudio.Templates
In this project I've tried to gather all the templates that I ended up using every single time that I was about to start a new project.

## Asp.Net Core with MongoDb and Authorization
This contains 4 projects inside of it.
1) [ProjectName].API
2) [ProjectName].DAL
3) [ProjectName].Infrastructure
4) [ProjectName].ServiceLayer

### How To Use
Clone this repository then navigate to the desired folder (depending which template you want) select all files and folders there
and compress them and create a zip file. Then copy that zip file into the *templates* location of your **Visual Studio 2017**. Now when you start Visual Studio 2017 and create a new project you will see newly added project templtes under the **Visual C#** section.

**This readme will be updated later on
