# VisualStudio.Templates
Handy VS 2017/2019 project templates

## Asp.Net Core api with MongoDb and Authorization
This contains 4 projects inside of it.
1) [ProjectName].API
2) [ProjectName].DAL
3) [ProjectName].Infrastructure
4) [ProjectName].ServiceLayer

### How To Use
Clone this repository then navigate to the desired folder (depending which template you want) select all files and folders there
and compress them and create a zip file. Then copy that zip file into the *templates* location of your **Visual Studio 2017(2019)** directory. Now when you start Visual Studio 2017 and create a new project you will see newly added project templtes under the **Visual C#** section.

## Future planes
1) Add new project [ProjectName].Test
2) Add ability to use microservices architecture
